			<!--When all of a sudden <PT_NUMBER_1> <PT_OBJECTS_1> fell from <PT_LOCATION_1>.

			<PT_USER> and<PT_FRIEND_1> grabbed the nearest <PT_OBJECTS_2> and ran for shelter. It looked like their road trip might not happen.

			Just as they were about to give up, <PT_FREIND_2> showed up with <PT_OBJECTS_3> and saved the day!

			Morale of the story: always remember to invite <PT_FREIND_2> on trips, or pack your own <PT_OBJECTS_3>.-->
